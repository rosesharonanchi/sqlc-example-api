# IkniteConnect

This repository contains the starter code for **IkniteConnect**, an API built using **Go**, the **sqlc** tool for safe database queries, and the **Gin web framework** for handling web requests.

IkniteConnect demonstrates a foundational backend for a social media application, focusing on secure user management and basic content creation. It serves as a core part of the Iknite Space training on Relational Databases.

## Application Features (What It Does)

The API supports the following core functions:

* **User Management:**
    * Users can **register** and **log in**.
    * **Security:** Passwords are never stored in plain text; we use the **bcrypt** library for secure password hashing.
* **Content (Post) Management:**
    * Users can **create, view, and delete posts**.
    * **Authorization:** Only **registered users** can create new posts.
* **Database Schema:** The project uses a PostgreSQL database with a defined **user schema** and **post schema**.


## Project Structure

* `api/`: **API Endpoints.** Contains the functions that handle incoming web requests (like `/register` or `/posts`). This is where you will add or change API functionality.
* `cmd/api/`: **Application Start.** Holds the main entry point (`main.go`) that starts the entire server. You generally won't need to change anything here.
* `db/migrations`: **Database Schema.** Contains the SQL files that create and update all the tables and columns in your database. Update these files when you need to change the database structure.
* `db/query`: **SQL Queries.** Contains pure SQL files (like `user.sql`, `post.sql`). **sqlc** reads these to automatically generate Go functions for database interaction.
* `db/repo/`: **Database Bridge.** Contains the Go code automatically generated by `sqlc`. This code acts as a safe, structured way for the `api/` handlers to talk to the database. You shouldn't need to edit files in this directory.


##  Getting Started

Follow these steps to get **IkniteConnect** running on your computer:

### 1. Get the Code

* **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
* **Clone** your fork to your local machine:
  
### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

* **Create a PostgreSQL database** (e.g., named `iknite_connect_db`).
* **Copy the example settings** file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
* **Edit the `.env` file** with your database connection details.

### 3. Install and Prepare

* Ensure you have **Go** installed.
* Get all necessary code libraries (dependencies):
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```
* If you change any SQL files (`db/query` or `db/migrations`), you must regenerate the Go code:
    ```bash
    go generate ./...
    ```

### 4. Run the Application

* Start the server:
    ```bash
    go run cmd/api/...
    ```
* The API will start and be available, typically on port 8080 (or the port defined in your `.env` file).
